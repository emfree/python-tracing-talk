- Using SystemTap - C profiling
- Do we really need a debug binary?
- What about JITted runtimes?
- Desired case study: capture perf issue that's visible with C-level insight
- Measuring overhead
- How hard is it to trace every function call? (e.g. for flame charts)
- Can we change the interpreter to make this easier (e.g., dtrace patches)

- Can we use eBPF?

- Tracing memory

- Tracing network or other I/O

- Compared to gdb/strace: how does overhead compare? What about permissions?


I ran `objcopy /path/to/python/binary --globalize-symbols=gil_last_holder` in
order to get a python traceback when the gil is released -- is this actually
necessary? or do we just need to call
    addr = &@var("gil_last_holder@Python/ceval.c", @PYTHON_LIBRARY);
in the stap script?
